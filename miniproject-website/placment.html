    <p><h3>Learning from books is always a good practice. You will get the big picture of programming concepts in the book which you may not find elsewhere.

        Here are some books we personally recommend.
        
        Introduction to Algorithms, Thomas H. Cormen - it is one of the best books in algorithms and covers a broad range of algorithms in-depth
        Algorithms, Robert Sedgewick - it is the leading textbook on algorithms and is widely used in colleges and universities
        The Art of Computer Programming, Donald E. Knuth - this book is considered best if you know the subject and are looking for deeper understanding!</h3></p>
